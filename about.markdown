Hello!

I am Dimitris Papageorgiou and I am currently studying Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece.

This summer you will find me busy working on NetworkX organization for the GSoC Program!

This site is my personal blog to keep updates regarding my work on NetworkX. My focus for the summer will be to implement Louvain Community Detection Algorithm.
